# shadcn UI

This project uses **shadcn UI** for all UI elements. Prefer shadcn components over custom implementations or other UI libraries.

## Initialization

If shadcn UI is not yet initialized in the project, run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

If a particular component is not installed, add it with the CLI. **Use the `shadcn@latest` package (not `shadcnui`).** For example, to install the button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

Replace `button` with the component name you need (e.g. `card`, `dialog`, `input`, `dropdown-menu`). Add components as needed before using them in the codebase.

## Usage

- Use shadcn UI components for buttons, forms, dialogs, navigation, and all other UI elements.
- Do not introduce other UI libraries for elements that shadcn provides.
- After adding a component, import and use it from the path configured by the project’s shadcn setup (typically under `src/components/ui/`).
